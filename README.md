# Spartan-Odyssey
A study app project for Seminar capstone course. 

Spartan Odyssey is a multipurpose study app designed to help NSU students build stronger and more effective study habits.

## Features
### Easy Note Organization
Notes are organized in a hierarchical format, enabling a multi-level breakdown of ideas. This hierarchy will be visualized physically and in the nested hierarchy of folders. 

### Engaging Testing
Spartan Odyssey provides a method of gamifying the testing process. Our testing features provides instant feedback and gamifies the memorization process in addition to traditional multiple choice tests. 
  Testing is provided in 3 modes:
- Practice Mode: Gamified testing mode that provides instant feedback
- Traditional Mode: Time-limited testing mode that mimics more traditional testing environments
- Exam Mode: A more extreme version of traditional testing that mimics an exam environment

### Study Habit Building
Our study app helps students build better study habits by allowing students to plan their study sessions out in advance. 
  Students will be able to set goals and objectives for each study sessions, allowing them to have purposeful and goal-driven studying. 
  Students can manage their study session times through our calendar planner, allowing them to take charge of their study planning and ensure they know when they are studying in a visual way. 
  Spartan Odyssey email students to notify of when their designated study sessions begin.

In a study session, students will have the ability to silence oncoming notifications and turn on a timer to track their studying habits.
